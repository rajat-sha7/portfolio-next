                  Codacora made the transition from our physical yoga space, to

                  preserved the essence of our teaching, made it accessible and

                <h3>Yoga Vastu</h3>
                <p>
                  Iyengar yoga aims at developing clear and continuous
                  attention, bringing consciousness to each part of the body,
                  exploring the effects of the mind on the body and the body on
                  the mind. Through this practice, Iyengar has been known to
                  lower anxiety, reduce sleeplessness and improve concentration.
                  See our learning resources to understand how Iyengar could
                  benefit you.
